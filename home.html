                    <h3>Masai Mara</h3>
                    <p>Masai Mara National Reserve is one of the most famous safari destinations on the continent, but you can escape the crowds by heading to a private concession or conservancy on the edge of the reserve. Aside from not being accessible to day-trippers or those not staying in one of the conservancies’ lodges or tented camps, the conservancies have the advantage of allowing activities not permitted in the national reserve: bush walks and night drives, for example. The Masai Mara is one of the best places in Africa for big cat sightings: lions, leopards and cheetahs are all relatively easy to spot. Then of course, there’s the big-ticket draw: the year-round migration that sees nearly two million wildebeest, plus half a million antelopes and thousands of zebras, following the rains around Tanzania and Kenya. The most anticipated part of this journey is the dramatic Mara River crossings that occur between July or August and October as the animals enter Kenya.</p>

                    <h3>Diani Beach</h3>
                    <p>Easily amongst the most picturesque shores in Africa, Diani Beach is about 30km/20mi south of Mombasa and a short flight from Nairobi. Its white sands are lapped by the brilliant Indian Ocean and backed by verdant forests, into which you can take nature walks when you tire of sunbathing or kite-surfing. Head out for a snorkeling tour, swim with whale sharks, enjoy a sunset dhow cruise – or simply kick back in a hammock with a good book.</p>

                    <h3>Lamu Town</h3>
                    <p>Kenya is not only noted for its safari reserves and savannah but also for its Indian Ocean coastline. The Lamu archipelago is amongst the most interesting places to visit in Kenya as an area brimming with history. Lamu town was founded around 1370 as a Swahili port that has since been inhabited by Europeans, Indians and Persians. As such, it’s a melting pot of multicultural influences. There are 23 mosques, a 19th-century fort and traditional dhow boats bobbing offshore. Then of course there are the surrounding peaceful and unspoilt beaches. The perfect place to unwind after a Kenyan safari tour.</p>
